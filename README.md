ACRA PHP Frontend

I am new to GitHub. Please advise if there's something wrong.

This has to be installed on a Apache/PHP/*SQL machine configuration.
MySQL server connection has to be configured in ./www/mysql.php
Table should already be created.

ACRA should sent reports to http://server/path/to/submit.php
